/**
 * First duplicate
 *
 *  given an array that contains numbers only in the range from 1 to a-length, find the first duplicate
 *  number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. Hence, if there is more than one duplicate
 *  in your list youâ€™ll return the number for which the second occurrence has the smaller index. If you canâ€™t
 *  find any then return -1.
 *
 * Example 1
 *  For a =[2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2], the output should be firstDuplicate(a)=3
 *  Explanation: there are 2 duplicate numbers 2 and 3, however, the second occurrence of number 3 is smaller
 *  than the second occurrence of number 2 duplicate
 *
 * Example 2
 * For a=[1,2,3,4,5], the output should be firstDuplicate(a)=-1
 * Indeed, there is no duplicate in this list!
 *
 * Check: Not in Leet Code
