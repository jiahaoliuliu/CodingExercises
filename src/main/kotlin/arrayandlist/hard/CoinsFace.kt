/**
 * Statement
 * Given a positive integer k and a sequence of coin flip results, find the longest continuous subsequence
 * containing exactly k times more heads than tails.
 *      H = Head
 *      T = Tail
 * Example:
 *  - K = 2 HTHHTHHHHHTH
 *
 * Hint:
 *  Given an array, positive and negative. Find the longest array which the sum of all the items is zero
 *
 * Example 1:  [5, 1, 0, 2, -3, 4, 2]
 *      - Output [1, 0, 2, -3]
 *
 * Example 2: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
 *      - Output []
 *
 * Example 3: [1, 9, -1, -2, 3, 0, 4, -2, -2, 3, 4]
 *      - Output [-1, -2, 3, 0, 4, -2, -2]
 *
 * Example 4: [10, 3, 4, -2, 4, -5, 8, 9, -12, 6]
 *      - Output [4, -2, 4, -5, 8, 9, -12]
